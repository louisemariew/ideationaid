<h2>About The Ideator</h2>
<br>
The Ideator is a tool where you can create idea boards to explore word connections.
Enter a word on the board and click on nodes to expand them with further searches.
<br>
Alternatively, add more words to the board that aren't already connected to existing
words in some way - the Ideator will find any common connections that come up!
<br>

<br>
You can filter your searches on the <b>degree of connection</b> and the <b>number of word suggestions</b> you would like.
<br>
<br>
<b>Degree of connection is defined as:</b>
<ul>
<li> 0 for <u>lateral connections</u> - those which are unusual and unexpected connections to the search word.</li>
<li> 0.25 for connections that are more lateral than literal in their connection to the search word.</li>
<li> 0.5 for connections that could be considered partially literal or lateral in their connection to the word.</li>
<li> 0.75 for connections that are more literal than lateral in their connection to the search word.</li>
<li> 1 for <u>literal connections</u> - those which are highly related and relevant to the search word.</li>
</ul>
<br>
We hope you enjoy using this tool! Click on the <a href="/app/#/boards"><b> Idea Board</b></a> tab to get started.
